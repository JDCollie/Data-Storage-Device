	description = Thanks to advances in data compression, the MPL-DSD-2 offers significantly greater data storage than its predecessor, and enhanced interfaces improve the effectiveness of even the most inattentive scientist. The improvements come at a price, however, as the DSD-2 also requires more power and is much more expensive.
