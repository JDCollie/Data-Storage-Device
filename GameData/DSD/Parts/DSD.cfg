	description = While the Mobile Processing Lab has proven to be a powerful tool, initial tests have demonstrated some notable shortfalls, most notably a very small data storage capacity. JDI has reduced the crew capacity and used the extra space to add a series of high density data storage devices. This allows for greater data stockpiling, but has the disadvantage of having a huge constant power drain. The DSD controller can also act as a rudimentary command module, but the power requirements and lack of reaction wheels make it poorly suited for the task.
